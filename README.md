## **_Getting Started_**

1. Press start
2. Enter each player's first name into the corresponding box
3. Player 1 (blue) goes first
4. On your turn:
   - Perform actions (optional)
   - Roll the dice to end your turn
   - Follow the prompts for your roll
5. Take all your friend's money!
6. Just like real life, Grantopoly allows you to go into debt to pay rent or taxes but not to buy houses or unmortgage properties.
7. Be careful! If your total value drops below 0, you lose!
